PROJECT:

A Unity game based on two levels:

1)dodge the blocks
2)kill the final boss

This is a first person game. The player is on a stage and he could move only left to right. You have eto fight againts sime blocks and after a run, reach a door and go to kill the boss. 

You will use Emotiv (a helmet controlled by EEG impulses) to shoot the blocks, Leap (an infrared sensor capable of recognizing a hand) to move the player left to right and Tobii(an eyetracking system) to look around and aim the blocks.
